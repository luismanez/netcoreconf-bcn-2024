```json
{
  "Prompt": "<system~\u003E## Instructions
Explain how to achieve the user\u0027s goal using the available helpers with a Handlebars .Net template.

## Example
If the user posed the goal below, you could answer with the following template.</system~\u003E
<user~\u003E## Goal
I want you to generate 10 random numbers and send them to another helper.</user~\u003E
<assistant~\u003EHere\u0027s a Handlebars template that achieves the goal:
\u0060\u0060\u0060handlebars
{{!-- Step 0: Extract key values --}}
{{set
  \u0022count\u0022
  10
}}
{{!-- Step 1: Loop using the count --}}
{{#each
  (range
    1
    count
  )
}}
  {{!-- Step 2: Create random number --}}
  {{set
    \u0022randomNumber\u0022
    (Example-Random
      seed=this
    )
  }}
  {{!-- Step 3: Call example helper with random number and print the result to the screen --}}
  {{set
    \u0022result\u0022
    (Example-Helper
      input=randomNumber
    )
  }}
  {{json (concat \u0022The result\u0022 \u0022 \u0022 \u0022is:\u0022 \u0022 \u0022 result)}}
{{/each}}
\u0060\u0060\u0060</assistant~\u003E
<system~\u003ENow let\u0027s try the real thing.</system~\u003E
<user~\u003EThe following helpers are available to you:

## Built-in block helpers
- \u0060{{#if}}{{/if}}\u0060
- \u0060{{#unless}}{{/unless}}\u0060
- \u0060{{#each}}{{/each}}\u0060
- \u0060{{#with}}{{/with}}\u0060

## Loop helpers
If you need to loop through a list of values with \u0060{{#each}}\u0060, you can use the following helpers:
- \u0060{{range}}\u0060 \u2013 Generates a list of integral numbers within a specified range, inclusive of the first and last value.
- \u0060{{array}}\u0060 \u2013 Generates an array of values from the given values (zero-indexed).

IMPORTANT: \u0060range\u0060 and \u0060array\u0060 are the only supported data structures. Others like \u0060hash\u0060 are not supported. Also, you cannot use any methods or properties on the built-in data structures.

## Math helpers
If you need to do basic operations, you can use these two helpers with numerical values:
- \u0060{{add}}\u0060 \u2013 Adds two values together.
- \u0060{{subtract}}\u0060 \u2013 Subtracts the second value from the first.

## Comparison helpers
If you need to compare two values, you can use the \u0060{{equals}}\u0060 helper.
To use the math and comparison helpers, you must pass in two positional values. For example, to check if the variable \u0060var\u0060 is equal to number \u00601\u0060, you would use the following helper like so: \u0060{{#if (equals var 1)}}{{/if}}\u0060.

## Variable helpers
If you need to create or retrieve a variable, you can use the following helpers:
- \u0060{{set}}\u0060 \u2013 Creates a variable with the given name and value. It does not print anything to the template, so you must use \u0060{{json}}\u0060 to print the value.
- \u0060{{json}}\u0060 \u2013 Generates and prints a JSON string from the given value.
- \u0060{{concat}}\u0060 \u2013 Concatenates the given values into one string.

## Custom helpers
Lastly, you have the following custom helpers to use.

### \u0060GraphSkillsPlugin-GetMySkills\u0060

<user~\u003E## Goal
I need to compose a Resume for Peter Parker who\\u0027s been working as a SW architect in the last 10 year, and he\\u0027s an expert in MS technologies

</user~\u003E

<system~\u003E## Tips and reminders
- Add a comment above each step to describe what the step does.
- Each variable should have a well-defined name.
- Be extremely careful about types. For example, if you pass an array to a helper that expects a number, the template will error out.
- Each step should contain only one helper call.

## Start
Follow these steps to create one Handlebars template to achieve the goal:
0. Extract Key Values:
  - Read the goal and any user-provided content carefully and identify any relevant strings, numbers, or conditions that you\u0027ll need. Do not modify any data.
  - When generating variables or helper inputs, only use content that the user has explicitly provided or confirmed. If the user did not explicitly provide specific information, you should not invent or assume this information.
  - Use the \u0060{{set}}\u0060 helper to create a variable for each key value.
  - Omit this step if no values are needed from the initial context.
1. Choose the Right Helpers:
  - Use the provided helpers to manipulate the variables you\u0027ve created. Start with the basic helpers and only use custom helpers if necessary to accomplish the goal.
  - Always reference a custom helper by its full name.
2. Don\u0027t Create or Assume Unlisted Helpers:
  - Only use the helpers provided. Any helper not listed is considered hallucinated and must not be used.
  - Do not invent or assume the existence of any functions not explicitly defined above.
3. What if I Need More Helpers?
  - If the goal cannot be fully achieved with the provided helpers or you need a helper not defined, print the following message: \u0022Additional helpers or information may be required\u0022.
4. Keep It Simple:
  - Avoid using loops or block expressions. They are allowed but not always necessary, so try to find a solution that does not use them.
  - Your template should be intelligent and efficient, avoiding unnecessary complexity or redundant steps.
5. No Nested Helpers:
  - Do not nest helpers or conditionals inside other helpers. This can cause errors in the template.
6. Output the Result:
  - Once you have completed the necessary steps to reach the goal, use the \u0060{{json}}\u0060 helper to output the final result.
  - Ensure your template and all steps are enclosed in a \u0060\u0060\u0060 handlebars block.

Remember, the objective is not to use all the helpers available, but to use the correct ones to achieve the desired outcome with a clear and concise template.

      About Me:

      I am Peter Parker, a seasoned Software Architect with a decade of experience specializing in Microsoft Technologies. My expertise lies in .NET Framework, C#, ASP.NET, SQL Server, Azure, Visual Studio, and PowerShell. I have a proven track record of designing and implementing robust, scalable solutions, and leading development teams to success.

      I have had the privilege of working with three of the leading companies in the Microsoft Technologies domain: Microsoft, Accenture, and Infosys. At Microsoft, I was instrumental in developing a cloud migration strategy that resulted in a 30% reduction in operational costs. At Accenture, I led a team that successfully delivered a complex enterprise-level application, which increased the company's efficiency by 20%. At Infosys, I received the 'Architect of the Year' award for my innovative solutions and leadership skills.

      In addition to my technical skills, I am known for my excellent communication and team management abilities. I am proficient in English and Spanish, which has enabled me to work effectively with diverse teams. My problem-solving skills and adaptability have consistently helped me thrive in dynamic project environments.

      Outside of my professional life, I am an avid rock climber and a photography enthusiast. I believe these hobbies have helped me develop patience, focus, and an eye for detail, traits that are invaluable in my professional role. I also enjoy cooking Italian cuisine and exploring the world of gourmet coffee, which allows me to experiment with flavors and indulge my creative side.\n\nSkills:\nSure, here are the skills with their brief descriptions:

      1. API Design: This involves the process of developing software interfaces that allow different software applications to interact with each other. It includes decisions on the structure of requests, responses, error handling, and documentation. Good API design helps software components to communicate effectively.

      2. SPFx (SharePoint Framework): This is a page and web part model from Microsoft that provides full support for client-side SharePoint development, easy integration with SharePoint data, and support for open source tooling. It allows developers to create modern SharePoint experiences.

      3. TypeScript: This is an open-source programming language developed by Microsoft. It's a statically typed superset of JavaScript that compiles to plain JavaScript. TypeScript adds optional types, classes, and modules to JavaScript, aiming to support large-scale applications.
      ```

      The `json` at the end is not really necessary in this case since `concat` already returns a string, but for consistency with other templates and to ensure the output is a valid string, I kept it. Here is the final template without the `json`:

      ```handlebars
